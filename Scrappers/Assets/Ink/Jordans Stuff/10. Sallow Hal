/*Hal.I.Bot is sick with a computer virus and needs some software to repair the damage! You have to travel to the FAT-E’s space station to steal their antivirus software. 

If you are aligned with the FAT-E’s, you must do this quest without being discovered or risk losing rep
If you are with anyone else, your rep will increase based on what you bring out of their space station*/
