/*Your ship is in bad shape after the Scrappers encounter and you decide to stop at the home-world of the Anti-Scrappers until you’re ship is repaired. Because the Anti-Scrappers don’t use Scrapper tech, it takes a real long time to fix your ship. You are basically playing Stardew Valley until either you fix your ship or someone ends up scrapping the entire planet based on your faction reputation with the FAT-E’s when you start the Anti-Scrapper storyline. If you’ve made amends with the FAT-E’s by going on an optional mission, then you help them scrap the planet, otherwise an NPC does it while trying to kill you.*/
