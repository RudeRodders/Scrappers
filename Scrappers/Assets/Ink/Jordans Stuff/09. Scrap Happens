/*Your ship has run out of power and is drifting. You must use your scrap creator to replace the sections that are broken, at the expense of tearing down pieces of the ship. Gradually, the ship will shrink and shrink until finally you come across a fabricator that can replace the missing parts. 

Rewards: You will receive a more efficient scrap convertor blueprint*/
