/*Highly sentient toddler threatens player with horrible death if they donâ€™t steal The Rolling Scone, the super fast ship owned by Socrates, head of either the aliens or another faction.

If Aliens, it is being stolen to keep them Terralocked
If another faction, it is being stolen to give an edge to a competitor

Rewards: Large amount of Scrap and a Legendary item (I was thinking something for construction/deconstruction or a nicer weapon/stealth drive or something idk)*/
